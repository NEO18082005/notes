    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to ensure secure and efficient management of tasks within the Task Master application. The core principle is Authorization Independence, achieved by storing tasks in user-specific collections, thus eliminating the need for complex authorization rules that rely on parent document data. Tasks are stored under `/users/{userId}/tasks/{taskId}` to ensure that only the user who owns the tasks has access to them. This path-based ownership drastically simplifies security rules. This structure also allows for easy listing of tasks for a specific user. It provides robust QAPs (Rules are not Filters) because listing will be simple and secure."
